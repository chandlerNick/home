This is the GitHub landing page for anyone finding me on the internet.

In case you have not previously read about me, here is a short description:

I am an aspiring technology professional and have just obtained a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science from Western Washington University. I am looking to go to graduate school in Germany or Austria to study Data Science, AI, or Cybersecurity. Thereafter, I hope to start a fruitful career in technology where I can continue to build things and learn about technology.
