1. This program is essentially a "next-word predictor". What I think it does is the following, read a bunch of text and store frequencies of words for n-grams (chunks of words of n-length) then start generating sentences based on the number of n words it is using to predict the next word. For example, for a trigram with the initial words: "the boy" it may predict the next word to be "and" based on the training data and the frequency which and appears after the initial two words. This would return the trigram: "the boy and". In this assignment, I will implement methods in the LanguageModel.java file to attain this end result.
2. I think the most challenging part of this assignment will be doing the read/write to files and debugging. I also think that figuring out how the skeleton code is meant to be put together will be challenging until I have a good idea of it. Finally, I think testing the code may be challenging and working out the final little bugs.
3. I plan to work on this assignment after class on Mondays and Wednesdays from 3-5, and Sundays or Saturdays from 8-12. I will also get a good start this Monday since there are no classes. If additional time is necessary I will alter this schedule early on.
4. If I get stuck on something, I will first look to google. Then I may ask my friend at a different school (who also knows java) about a specific problem. If I cannot figure out what is wrong after this I will go to office hours and Meet with a TA or my Professor. (If it is not ok to contact my friend due to academic dishonesty, I will not do so).
