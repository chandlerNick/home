In this project, I programmed the algorithm to conduct K-Means clustering on a set of feature vectors organized in a matrix. 
Essentially, the algorithm consists of the steps which repeat until the cumulative distance of points to their respective centroids is minimized: 
  1. Compute centroids
  2. Compute distances of each observation to each centroid
  3. Assign observations to the closest centroid

This exercise aided in the development of my R Programming skills as well as my understanding of the K-Means clustering algorithm, a popular machine learning algorithm with applications in business such as customer segmentation.
